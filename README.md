# Project: Task Reminder System
=>Objective: Build a task reminder system that schedules reminders and handles asynchronous delays.

@ Tasks:-
->Create an array of task objects, where each task has fields like title, dueTime (in minutes from now), and priority.
  
# Write functions to:
  ->Add a new task to the list.
  ->Sort tasks by their priority.
  ->Display tasks due within a certain timeframe (e.g., next 10 minutes).
  ->Simulate sending reminders using setTimeout() based on the task's dueTime.
  ->Use try...catch to handle errors, such as invalid task data or missing fields.Export and import the task management functions using Jav aScript modules.
